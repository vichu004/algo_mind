# Algomind — Landing Page

This is a simple, responsive landing page for a software products company. Files included:

- `index.html` — the page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — small interactions (nav, form)
- `assets/logo.svg` — simple logo

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).
2. Edit content and styles to match your brand.
